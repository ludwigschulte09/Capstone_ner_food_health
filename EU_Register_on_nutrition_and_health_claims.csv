Zeaxanthin ist ein wichtiges antioxidativ zellschützender vitaminähnlicher Lebensmittelinhaltsstoff für den Menschen mit besonderer Bedeutung für den Lichtschutz.
Als vergleichsweise schwaches Antioxidans kann Zeaxanthin durch die stärkeren antioxidativen Nährstoffe bzw. körpereigenen Antioxidantien – z. B. die Thiole Glutathion, Cystein und Liponsäure - teilweise gegen Oxidation geschützt werden.
Umgekehrt gibt es Hinweise, dass eine hohe Zufuhr von Carotinoiden wie Zeaxanthin auch einen positiven Einfluss auf den Status bei den anderen körpereigenen Antioxidantien hat.
Hohe Mengen an Zeaxanthin sollten aus theoretischen Erwägungen wegen der erforderlichen Regeneration durch die körpereigenen antioxidativen Schutzsysteme zusammen mit anderen antioxidativen Nährstoffen supplementiert werden. Das gilt insbesondere für Personen mit erfahrungsgemäß schlechtem antioxidativem Status (z. B. Raucher, Diabetiker).
Zeaxanthin ist ein effizienter Fänger von freien Radikalen.
Nach der antioxidativen Rangordnung der Carotinoide wird Zeaxanthin im Auge erst nach Vitamin E, ß-Carorin, Lycopin und Lutein verbraucht.–Zeaxanthin ist für das Auge wahrscheinlich die letzte Sicherung gegen oxidative Schäden.
